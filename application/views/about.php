            <h4>Forexbitcapital.biz (HYIP Monitors) </h4>
            There are many and varied HYIP and HYIP monitors, some are very Most trusted and some are just a fake. We have two main aims. One is the union of all the HYIP monitors in one place. The second one includes advanced HYIP investigation with many additional parameters, like IP, hosting provider, numbers and quality of HYIP monitors, who is, etc. <br /><br />

            Some HYIP programs may leave only good status seals on their sites and remove or forge bad once. With our site you may check all HYIP monitors of any HYIP. Also some HYIP monitors may accept 'special monitor' plans, may promote SCAM. That is why we have monitor ranking. <br /><br />
            Hope that you will find our project to be useful. The site is now being updated; some of the links might be wrong but will be fixed soon! <br /><br />
            <h4>Welcome to the Forexbitcapital.biz HYIP rating website!</h4>

            <br /><br />
            We know what it's like to browse tons of rating websites packed with advertisements that obviously bring profit merely to their owners and no-one else. Isn't it tiring to discover, from site to site, the evident agreement between HYIPs listings owners and HYIPs administrators, with the latter giving scam HYIPs high rank and never caring about the investors' money?
            <br /><br />
            Despite the above-mentioned sad facts, our team, however, has not been disappointed in the HYIPs sphere. Far from that, we have always been and remain sure that this is the very way for making money! <br /><br />
            We have come up with the most honest HYIP Rating website developed specially for you! <br /><br />
            <strong>Why choose us?</strong> <br /><br />

            1) All the programs we present have absolutely equal chances. No fees are charged for the highest rate on our web site. <br /><br />
            2) We have an independent HYIPs monitoring system that sums the rating of each program in conformity with 4 factors and ascribes a certain rank.  <br />
            - Lifetime (days) Investment Program life period, counted since the opening date.
            - Monitoring (days) - Investment Program monitoring period, counted since the date of submitting to our site. <br />
            - Admin rate - Our personal rating of an Investment Program. We study each program most thoroughly taking into consideration its design, safety of the basis script, public opinion available on forums and rate. <br />
            - User rate - The amount of all votes given to the Investment Program. When voting, visitors leave their e-mail address for the purpose of subsequent voting confirmation; their IP addresses are also determined by our system. <br />
            This approach provides maximum warranty against unfaithful investment program administrators who might wish to cheat and boost their rating. <br />
            - Funds return (%) - Indicator, which has no connection to a program's rating position. The figure specifies the ratio of the profit gained from a program to the amount invested into it. <br />
            All of the above proves that our program is a perfect solution for those who would like to get detailed information on Investment Programs and succeed in this complicated deal. <br />
